This is a backup repo. Create by agentcore starter toolkit, infinite request to cognito after deploy on AWS.

## Root Cause Identification
Through collaboration with AWS Support, we confirmed that the high volume of Cognito requests stems from the interaction between the AgentCore pre-warming logic and its authentication lifecycle:

- Pre-warming Loop
    - When AgentCore Runtime deployed using an ECR image, AgentCore attempts to reduce cold starts by keeping ~10 MicroVMs active.
- Idle Termination
    - The default idle timeout (approx. 15 minutes) causes these MicroVMs to shut down frequently.
- Auto-Redeployment
    - The runtime immediately spawns new instances to maintain the pre-set capacity, leading to a "termination-reprovision" loop.
- Auth Impact
    - The toolkit-generated runtime performs M2M (Machine-to-Machine) authentication every time a new instance starts (At beginning of FastAPI lifespan). This constant cycling generated a massive spike in Cognito traffic, incurring a cost of ~$50 USD.
